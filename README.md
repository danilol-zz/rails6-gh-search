# README

Very simple app to search public repositories from github using Rails 6.

**Authentication is not working properly, affecting searchs with big number of results, so it returns an error for reaching the request limits.

Some suggested search:
 - usernames
 - byebug
 - bootsnap
 - factory_bot_rails
 - will_paginate
 - paper-trail

## Setup
`git clone `

`bundle`

`bundle exec rails s`

## Tests
To run the controller tests:

`bundle exec rspec`

## TODO list:
- [ ] Capybara tests
- [ ] Authentication is not working properly
